Dynamic Memory Management Simulator
-----------------------------------
This program implements dynamic memory management within a simulated environment.

### Build Instructions
To build this project simply run: gcc -o [result_program] dmm_sim.c Replacing [result_program] with the name of the executable program you desire.

Note: I built this project on a Macbook Pro, which may use a slightly different version of gcc than expected.

### Run Instructions
To run this project, execute: ./result_program

You should see the logs of the memory management simulation printed to the terminal.
